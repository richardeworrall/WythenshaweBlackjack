To Do
------------------------------------------

- Check rules around aces
- Check if you can link Black Jack -> 2
- Strategy should return an action (which the game then validates, then applies)
- Option for King --> reverse
- Last card(s)!
- Multiple games up to 501 etc.

Done
------------------------------------------

- Must go if you have a valid chain
- Can end on king, but must pick up one
- Can't play King on its own
- Block black jack with a red jack
- Aces change suit -> can follow with anything, or nominate next suit
- Can chain penalty cards -> change strategy if facing a pick up!
